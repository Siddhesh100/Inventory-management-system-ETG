# Inventory-management-system-ETG
# Brief description
In the inventory management system, we can manage all our products stored in the system step by step. From adding new products to purchasing those products, we can keep track of our products. The user can add as many products as possible to the inventory at once, and the products will also be updated in the Jason file.
